quarter project

i want to be able to find a recipe with what i have at home...

when i select items in the drop down menu and hit submit, recipes should generate based off of what i chose

i want for the contents of the page to reset when i hit the 'find another recipe button'?

if values match then return recipe to user first using innerHTML updates 

how to create matching aspect? 

should i store my objects in an array and parse through the array? if my object matches all three keys of an object display the matching object? 


i want something to iterate over the objects and return true if it finds an object that matches everything.... 

what can i use here? can i use that object in key thing? 

instead of recipes being stored as objects, i could store them as an array within a string, and look for matching recipes

^ with the above method i would need to store the user results as a string.... simpler?
