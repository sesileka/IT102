    /// website will be shaped like a book or a journal and the user will be able to click on the journal and take a look at the recipes 
    /// 'search for a recipe tab'
    ///on the 'search for a recipe tab' there will be a space where the user can enter up to three ingredients 
    /// it could be a drop down menu for simplicity, and then depending on what is chosen it'll take the user to a new page with all of the recipes. 
    /// user will input ingredients... could use text box like for grocery list... or could have it be seperate text boxes and limit to 3 or so
    /// if ingredients match items in recipe book, return the recipe and display it via innerHTML OR...... 
    /// have the user choose between different recipes 
    ///recipes must already be defined... 
    /// can it be possible to view the recipes via just clicking on stuff on the page lol
